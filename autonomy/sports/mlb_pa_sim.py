"""Plate-appearance Monte Carlo simulator for MLB games (`mlb_pa_sim`).

Simulates a game one plate appearance at a time: each batter vs the current
pitcher, combined by the Bill James log5 odds ratio against league average,
platoon- and park-adjusted. One simulated game yields a winner, a run total,
a first-inning run flag, and a first-five-innings result; aggregating many
games yields coherent market probabilities. Pure, offline, deterministic.
